# ProgrammingMasterclass
This channel is all about that Data Structures and Algorithms Here you will learn the implementation 
of data structures and algorithms in C++. The channel includes recorded videos for learning the fundamentals
and problem based on that. More than 100 of coding problems focused on algorithms for practice by which you 
will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems. Since the channel is news I am
continuously adding the contents. Since this is the specialization course on the Data structures and algorithms
I will assume that you are comfortable with atleast any one programming language. I am using C++ in this course.
